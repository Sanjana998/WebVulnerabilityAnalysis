those cookies are not marked 'HttpOnly', meaning that a malicious
client-side script, such as JavaScript, could read them. The HttpOnly
flag is a security mechanism to protect against cross-site scripting
attacks, which was proposed by Microsoft and initially implemented in
Internet Explorer. All modern browsers now support it.

Note that this plugin detects all general cookies missing the HttpOnly
cookie flag, whereas plugin 48432 (Web Application Session Cookies
Not Marked HttpOnly) will only detect session cookies from an
authenticated session missing the HttpOnly cookie flag.","Each cookie should be carefully reviewed to determine if it contains
sensitive data or is relied upon for a security decision.

According to its version, the installation of PHP on the remote host
is no longer supported.
Lack of support implies that no new security patches for the product
will be released by the vendor. As a result, it is likely to contain
security vulnerabilities.


The remote host is running a version of PHP that is older than 4.3.9 or
5.0.2.The remote version of this software is affected by an unspecified file
upload vulnerability that could allow a local attacker to upload arbitrary files to the server.


According to its self-reported version, the Tenable Nessus application running on the 
remote host is prior to 6.9.3. It is, therefore, affected by multiple stored cross-site scripting
 (XSS) vulnerabilities due to improper validation of user-supplied input.


Multiple unspecified flaws exist in the InnoDB subcomponent that allow an authenticated,
 remote attacker to cause a denial of service condition.

unarr.go in go-unarr (aka Go bindings for unarr) 0.1.1 allows Directory Traversal via ../ in a pathname within a TAR archive.

The remote host is running Ultimate PHP Board (UPB).There is a flaw in this version which may allow an 
attacker to execute arbitrary code on this host, by sending a malformed user-agent which contains PHP commands. Once the user-agent has been sent, it is stored in the logs. When the administrator of this website will read the logs through admin_ip.php, the code will be executed.

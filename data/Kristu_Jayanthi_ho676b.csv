vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the
'frame-ancestors' directive) HTTP header with the page's response.
This prevents the page's content from being rendered by another site

flag is a security mechanism to protect against cross-site scripting
attacks, which was proposed by Microsoft and initially implemented in
Internet Explorer. All modern browsers now support it.

Note that this plugin detects all general cookies missing the HttpOnly
cookie flag, whereas plugin 48432 (Web Application Session Cookies
Not Marked HttpOnly) will only detect session cookies from an
authenticated session missing the HttpOnly cookie flag.","Each cookie should be carefully reviewed to determine if it contains
sensitive data or is relied upon for a security decision.

If possible, add the 'HttpOnly' attribute to all session cookies
and any cookies containing sensitive data.","https://www.owasp.org/index.php/HttpOnly","
